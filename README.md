# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

To improve this project I would give the menu items a hover element. When you hover over each menu item it would give you a list of the all the ingredients and a small picture would pop up to show you what the item looks like.
